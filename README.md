# Customer Churn Analysis Using SQL & Power BI
**Business Challenge**: A comprehensive analysis of Telco's data (a fictitious telecommunications company) to understand the main factors causing customer churn and identify actionable insights to reduce churn, retain customers, and recover lost revenue.

## Introduction
This project analyses customer churn for a telecommunications company using **SQL** for data querying and analysis, and **Power BI** for visualisation. The goal is to find out the causes of churn, measure the financial impact of losing customers, and figure out high-risk customer segments for better customer retention.

Customer churn is a serious issue in business. If customers are leaving a business or company, their revenue and profitability are negatively affected. How do factors like age, contract type, monthly charges, payment methods, internet service, tenure, and more, affect customer retention at Telco telecoms? Let's find out.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset:** Telco customer churn
- **Dataset Size:** 955 KB
- **Number of Customers:** 7,043
- **Number of Columns:** 21
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Key Fields:**
  - CustomerID, Gender, SeniorCitizen
  - ContractType, PaperlessBilling, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Tenure
  - StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, OnlineBackup, OnlineSecurity
  - InternetService, PaymentMethod, Churn
 
## Objectives
1. Measure overall customer churn rate.
2. Identify customer segments with the highest churn risk.
3. Understand the financial impact of churn on businesses
4. Figure out patterns in churn based on contract type, payment method, and internet services.
5. Provide insights for improved customer retention and increased revenue.

## Methodology
**1. Data Preparation & Cleaning**
- Downloaded dataset (TelcoData.csv) from Kaggle.
- Imported the TelcoData.csv dataset into SQL Server using the Import Wizard.
- Split the flat file into 5 normalised tables:
    - Customers
    - Contracts
    - Services
    - Billings
    - Churn
2. **Data Analysis using SQL**
- Joined tables to create a single customer view.
- Used CTEs, subqueries, and aggregations to calculate:
    - Overall churn rate
    - Monthly revenue and lost revenue from churn
    - Payment method, internet service, and contract type-based churn rates
    - Tenure-based churn patterns
3. **Data Visualisation using Power BI**
- Created a detailed 3-page dashboard covering:
  - **Overview:** A big picture of the company's financial performance and churn breakdown.

## Key Insights
### âœ… High Churn Rate Is a Major Business Risk
- Overall churn rate = 26.54% (approximately 1 in 4 customers are leaving)
- Lost revenue from churn = $2.86M (67% from customers on month-to-month contracts)

ðŸ”Ž**Insight:** A good experience early on helps keep customers longer.  
ðŸ“¢**What to Do**:
  - Improve customer onboarding and support.
  - Offer rewards for customers who stay past their first year.

### âœ… High Monthly Charges Increase Churn Risk
- Customers paying over $70/month have the highest churn rate (34.36%).

## Business Impact
ðŸ’¡ $2.86M in lost revenue â†’ Reducing churn among month-to-month customers could recover over $1.93M in lost revenue. Encouraging them to switch to 1 or 2-year contracts could help.  
ðŸ’¡ Fiber optic customers are valuable but at high risk of leaving â€“ improving retention in this group could help keep revenue steady.  
ðŸ’¡ Making payments easier (like setting up auto-pay with credit cards or bank transfers) could reduce churn.  
ðŸ’¡ Lower churn among customers with bundled security and backup shows that better service packages could help keep more customers.
